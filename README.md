This is a company webpage for a group of adventurers. 


Added a API to fetch equipment data for the shop page. 
Created a randomize function to add random items to the shop page.

Using Express created a CRUD app to make a shopping cart. In the shopping cart include the ability to delete an item from the list. The item count should display the correct price and set up the total at the bottom.
